# This is some examples of what the Reflex sripting language looks like
# Lines beginning with # are comments, and anything after a # in a line is a comment to the next new line
#

int x = 5;

# That was a variable assignment - the variable name x is pushed onto the frame and has the value 5

{
   # This is a new frame
   x = 6;
   # x above is the same x as in the outer loop
   int x = 2;
   # That is a different x, and when you change x you are changing this local one
}

# Now the value of x is back to 6 (from the assignment above)
#

func calc(a,b) int {
    # This defines a function object called calc that takes two parameters (x and y)
    return a+b;
}

#

int y = calc(3,4);

# y is now 7
#

if (a==b) {

} else {

}

# That was an if/else construct
#

# some variables are lists internally. Anything object that has a list interface can do:
#
for x in y {

}

# Where x is continually set to the elements of y
#

# break exits the for loop

# var is a general object that can be anything, you can use explicit types:
#

int x = 4;
string z = "Hello";
list y = [ 2,3,4];
data z;
func fred = calc; # The func type is a function

# data objects are maps of maps, you index explicitly by keys
#

z[test.fred.billy] = "Alan"

# The java object data type refers to a java object
#

obj rk;

# You can call methods on the object like this
#
rk.toString();
