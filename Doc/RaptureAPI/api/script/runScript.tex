The \verb+runScript+ executes a script on the \Rapture server. The parameters for the execution, passed
by this call, are simply transferred to the context of the executing script. It is up to the script itself to
interpret those parameters as it sees fit. The \verb+RaptureParameter+ entries set up with \verb+setScriptParameters+ or
\verb+putRawScript+ are simply guidelines for a UI.

The return value of this call is the return value of the execution of the script -- whatever it \verb+returns+.
