The Script API in \Rapture manages the creation and execution of scripts on the platform.

Scripts can be used as steps in workflows, run from events, run manually (through an API call
described here) or as a "micro service" that is part of a browser based application architecture.

Scripts are usually stored within \Rapture itself and can therefore be accessed and run from any
server in a \Rapture environment. The main scripting language used in \Rapture is an in built language
called \Reflex. \Reflex is a lightweight procedural language that has tight alignment with the
architectural design approach of \Rapture -- the use of URIs and typical use of JSON as a data format are
well aligned. At the end of this document the reference for the \Reflex language is included.
