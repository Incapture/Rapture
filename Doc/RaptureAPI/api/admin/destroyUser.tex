This method destroys a user record. The user must have been previously disabled using \verb+deleteUser+ before this method 
may be called. This is a severe method that should only be used in non-production machines or to correct an administrative
error in creating an account with the wrong name before that account has been used. Reference to the missing user may still
exist, and may not display properly in some UIs
