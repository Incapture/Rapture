The \verb+putDoc+ call writes data into a \Rapture document repository. The
data in a document repository is a simple string but this is usually formatted
as a JSON document. If the repository is versioned this call will write a new
version to the repository and set the latest version to be this version. If it
is not versioned this call will simply overwrite the current version.

If there is no document at this location the call will create a new document.

If the repository has an id generator attached to it (see the id API) the uri
can end in the special keyword \verb+#id+ a new unique id will be generated when
this document is written. The return value of this API call will then reflect
the actual location that was used to store this content.
