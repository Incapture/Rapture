The \verb+renameDoc+ call is an atomic wrapper around the \verb+deleteDoc+ and \verb+putDoc+.

The implementation simply retrieves the original document contents using
\verb+getDoc+ and then stores the document using \verb+putDoc+. Finally
the original document is deleted using \verb+deleteDoc+.

The entitlements check for this call also checks the entitlements for the
three calls it makes.
