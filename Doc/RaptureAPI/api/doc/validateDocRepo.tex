The \verb+validateDocRepo+ call is used to instruct the repository implementation to validate itself. The effect is
implementation specific but it usually means checking that the repository can be connected to and is a valid \Rapture
repository.

The parameter to the call is simply a uri pointing to the repository name. The call can throw an exception if the
repository is not found or the parameter passed is invalid. It returns true if the underlying implementation asserts
that the repository is valid.
