The \verb+setDocAttributes+ call takes an attribute uri prefix and then loops through
each key and value in the passed parameters and calls the \verb+setDocAttribute+ call for each.

For each invocation the \verb+attributeUri+ to the \verb+setDocAttribute+ call is formed using
the following production:

\begin{verbatim}
   attributeUriForCall = attributeUri + '/' + key
\end{verbatim}

An entitlement check is made for each individual call.
