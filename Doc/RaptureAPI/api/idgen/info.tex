The IdGen API is used to create providers of unique ids. Unique ids are needed when
creating documents or items in \Rapture that need to have a unique location or an id that
cannot be shared with another application or user making the same call at the same time.

Id generators are usually implemented on low level systems, typically the same systems used
to store data.
