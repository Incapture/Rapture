The \verb+addErrorToContext+ call is used to take any errors associated with the workflow
and add it to the variable set that can be accessed from steps in the workflow.

The errors are added as a list with the keyword \verb+errorList+.

This call is often made during step execution when processing a failure path in a workflow.
