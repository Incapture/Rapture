The \verb+deleteBlobRepo+ call removes a blob repository from a \Rapture system. The underlying
implementation of a repository driver determines whether the data associated with this repository
is also removed from the system.

Currently both the MongoDB and Cassandra implementations of blob repository simply remove the configuration
and not the data.
