The \verb+addEventNotification+ call is used to add a hook to publish a \Rapture notification when an event is fired.

The implementation of the event firing simply calls the Notification API \verb+publishNotification+ call with the message being a json
representation of the event message. The event message is described as part of the \verb+addEventMessage+ call.
