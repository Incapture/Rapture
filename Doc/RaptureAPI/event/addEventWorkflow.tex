The \verb+addEventWorkflow+ call is used to attach a workflow to the firing of an event.

When an event is fired this workflow will be started using the Decision API \verb+runWorkflow+ call. The parameters to
the workflow will be a combination of the event context parameters and the parameters to this call.
