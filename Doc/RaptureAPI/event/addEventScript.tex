The \verb+addEventScript+ call is used to add a \Reflex script to be executed when an event fires.

When the event is fired the script execution is placed on the internal pipeline queue so that the script
execution is scheduled alongside any other tasks running as part of workflows. The category of the task is set to
ALPHA which implies that any "general" \Rapture server running the default configuration could pick up this script and
execute it.
