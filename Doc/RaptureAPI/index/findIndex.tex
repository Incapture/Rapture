The \verb+findIndex+ call is used to find data in a \Rapture index. The query string is a SQL like
string that is best illustrated with an example:

\begin{Verbatim}
  SELECT endTime,
         startTime,
         priority,
         workOrderURI WHERE workOrderURI="ABC123"
\end{Verbatim}

As can be seen it is similar to SQL except that the "table" is not specified - it is provided
as the indexURI to the API call.

The return value is a result set structure.
