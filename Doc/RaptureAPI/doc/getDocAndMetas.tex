The \verb+getDocAndMetas+ call is a batch form of \verb+getDocAndMeta+. The return
value is the result of calling that function for each uri in the list passed to
the batch call and adding it to the return list. If the entitlement check fails
for the individual call a null is placed in the list at that point.
