Document repositories can have an id generator attached to them. If a document is added to
a repository and it contains a "\verb+#id+" suffix the id generator will replace that keyword with
a newly generated unique id.

The \verb+setDocRepoIdGenConfig+ is used to define the configuration for such a generator.

In a manner similar to the general repository configuration an id generator is defined using
a configuration string that conforms to a domain specific language (DSL). A typical example is
reproduced below:

\begin{verbatim}
IDGEN {} USING MONGODB { prefix = 'testid' }
\end{verbatim}

In this example MongoDB is used as the id generator and this is the only option in the open
source version of \Rapture.
