The \verb+getDoc+ API call is used to retrieve content from a document repository
in \Rapture. The single parameter \verb+docUri+ is a string that defines the
location of the document within the \Rapture system. It can optionally be
prefixed with the \verb+document:+ scheme qualifier. Depending on the client
side implementation the call can throw an exception if the repository is not
existent or the entitlements of the server prohibit such access. Some implementations
wrap the document does not exist failure into returning a null value from this
API call.

In the \Reflex scripting language a caller can use the \emph{pull} operator (\verb+<--+)
to retrieve a document from \Rapture and convert its contents from JSON to a \Reflex map
of maps. This call will fail if the document is not in JSON format.
