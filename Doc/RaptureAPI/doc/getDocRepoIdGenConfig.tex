Document repositories can have an id generator attached to them. If a document is added to
a repository and it contains a "\verb+#id+" suffix the id generator will replace that keyword with
a newly generated unique id.

The \verb+getDocRepoIdGenConfig+ call retrieves the configuration of the associated id generator
that was previously set with the \verb+setDocRepoIdGenConfig+ call.
