The \verb+docRepoExists+ call is used to test whether a given named repository is known
to the \Rapture environment. The method takes a single repo name as a parameter and returns
true or false according to an existence check. This call is typically used in an installation
script to determine whether a repository should be created using the \verb+createDocRepo+ call.
