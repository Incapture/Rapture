The \verb+setDocAttribute+ call is used to add an attribute to a document in a repository.

Attributes are metadata that can be used to place any arbitrary value on a document independent of its
content.

In the call an attribute uri is the combination of a document path (as seen in many other calls) with a
bookmark symbol (\verb+#+) followed by the name of an attribute. The value is a string value that has
meaning to the calling application.

The return value is true if the attribute was set by the repository.
