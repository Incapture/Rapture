The \verb+createScriptLink+ creates a soft reference between two scripts in \Rapture. A script link
points to 2nd script and whenever a script link is used to run a script the target script is
executed instead. It is effectively creating an \emph{alias} to that script.

Script links are removed using the \verb+removeScriptLink+ call.
