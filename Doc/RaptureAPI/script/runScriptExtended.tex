The \verb+runScriptExtended+ works in a similar way to \verb+runScript+ except that the standard output from the script execution
is captured and returned to the caller. The \verb+ScriptResult+ return value contains two fields - the
\verb+returnValue+ as per the \verb+runScript+ call and a list of (string) lines in the \verb+output+ field.
