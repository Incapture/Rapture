The Environment API is used to retrieve and manipulate information about the servers in
a \Rapture environment.

Appliance mode is a special state that can indicate that \Rapture is running in a single server mode. In this mode
certain updates are not propagated on the internal \Rapture coordination pipeline queues. It is used when significant restructuring
is being performed on the environment.
