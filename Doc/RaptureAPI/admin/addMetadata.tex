This function adds values to the metadata field of the \verb+CallingContext+. It's used to hold values specific to this connection. 
Since it's set by the caller the values cannot be considered entirely trusted, and private or secure data such as passwords shouldn't be stored in here.
If overwrite is false and an entry already exists then an exception should be thrown
