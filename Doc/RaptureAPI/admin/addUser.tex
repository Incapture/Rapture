This method adds a user to the \Rapture environment. The user will be in no entitlement groups by default. The password
field passed is actually the MD5 hash of the password - or at least the same hash function that will be applied when
logging in to the system (the password is hashed, and then hashed again with the salt returned during the login protocol).
