\Rapture is a hierarchical set of repositories, and this method returns the config of the top most level - that used
for general config and temporary (transient) values such as sessions. In clustered mode these configs would
be referencing shared storage, and in test mode they would normally refer to in-memory versions of the config.
The manipulation of the top level config can be performed through the Bootstrap API.
