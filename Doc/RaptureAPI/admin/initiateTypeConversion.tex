This method kicks off a process that will migrate a DocumentRepo to an alternate config. A temporary type will be created with the new config,
 the old type will be locked for modifications and then all of the documents in the existing type will be copied to the new type, with the metadata intact.
 Optionally a number of historical versions will be kept if the source repository (and target) support it. Once all of the data has been copied the config
 attached to each type will be swapped and the type released for access. The temporary type will then be dropped.
