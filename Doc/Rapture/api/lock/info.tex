The Lock API is used to manage lock providers (or managers). A lock manager can be used to coordinate a locking
activity between multiple servers, processes or threads in \Rapture. In general once a lock provider has been created
any process can acquire a named lock through that provider and hold it for a certain amount of time. The lock can either
auto-release after a timeout or be manually released through another api call. If another process attempts to acquire the same lock
it can block until the lock is available.

Lock providers are implemented on underlying systems - usually the same systems that provide storage. The definition of the Lock Manager wires the connection between a named provider and its implementation.
