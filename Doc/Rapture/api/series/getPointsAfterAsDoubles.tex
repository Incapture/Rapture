The most common way to page through points in a series is to use the \verb+getPointsAfter+ calls. In this call
a start column is specified (a zero length string implies the starting point in this case). A max number parameter
determines how many points could be returned.

If the return value contains "maxNumber" entries than the column name of the last point in that list can be
used as the starting point for the next "page" call.

The return value from this call contains a list of objects. Each object contains the column name and a value represented
as a double value.
