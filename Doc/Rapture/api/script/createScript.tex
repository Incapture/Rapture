The \verb+createScript+ call is used to define a script in \Rapture for the first time. If the
script already exists and is to be updated you should use the \verb+putScript+ call instead.

The language and purpose fields primarily exist for extensibility. You should use "REFLEX" and "PROGRAM"
for these fields.
