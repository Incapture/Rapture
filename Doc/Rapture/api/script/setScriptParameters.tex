The \verb+setScriptParameters+ can be used to define the parameters that this script should accept. It
is simply a recommendation -- no internal checks are made to see whether the script can actually accept these
parameters.

The definition of \verb+RaptureParameter+ is shown in the \verb+getScript+ call.
