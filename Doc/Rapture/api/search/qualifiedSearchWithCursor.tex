This api call works in a similar way to the \verb+qualifiedSearch+ call. The
call takes an additional cursor id parameter and the maximum size of the result set.

For the first call to this method for a given search the cursor id should be left blank or null. The search response
will contain a unique cursor id which can be used in subsequent calls. Cursors will ultimately be reaped from
the underlying system after a period of inactivity.
