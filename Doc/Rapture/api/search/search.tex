The search function is a simple call that performs like a qualified search but against
all of the tables associated with the index.

The format of the search parameter varies with underlying implementation. For
Elastic Search the implementation uses the QueryBuilder String format which allows
for search strings similar to those reproduced below:

\begin{Verbatim}
	trader:AM
	value:>10000
	AM
	BUY
	US*
	currency:US*
\end{Verbatim}

Here the term \emph{before} the colon refers to a field in the full text search
index and these can correspond to top level field names in JSON content of a
document, meta data or uri patterns.
