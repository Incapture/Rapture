The tag API is used to maintain tags associated with entities in \Rapture, and to
define and manage general descriptions about tag URIs for UI presentation.

Tags are applied to the metadata of an entity and as such changes to the metadata
result in changes of version for an entity. Because of this multi-change versions of
the api are provided to allow for multiple changes to be made in one version change.
