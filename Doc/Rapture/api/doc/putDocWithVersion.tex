The \verb+putDocWithVersion+ can be used to implement an optimistic locking
strategy for updating data into a repository. The approach is for an application
to load a document with its version using the \verb+getDocAndMeta+ call. The
application can then modify that document and use this call to store the
update, passing in the last known version. The call will succeed if and only if
no other program has modified the document -- in which case the version number
of the document will be incremented and not match.

If the version check fails the call will fail with an exception that will be
returned to the caller in a manner appropriate to the calling language implementation.
