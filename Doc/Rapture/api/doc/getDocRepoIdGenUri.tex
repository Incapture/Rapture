Document repositories can have an id generator attached to them. If a document is added to
a repository and it contains a "\verb+#id+" suffix the id generator will replace that keyword with
a newly generated unique id.

The \verb+getDocRepoIdGenUri+ returns the id generator internal uri that is associated with
this repository if it exists. Id generators can be independent of repositories (they can be used for
more than repository unique ids).
