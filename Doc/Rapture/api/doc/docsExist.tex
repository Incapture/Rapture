The \verb+docExists+ call is a batch form of the \verb+docExists+ call.

For each uri in the parameter to the call the \verb+docExists+ call is made
after an entitlement check. The return value of the call is added to the list
returned by this function. If the entitlement check fails a false is placed
in its position in the return list.
