The \verb+putDocs+ call is a wrapper around a loop to the \verb+putDoc+ call. For each
uri/content pair the entitlements for a given store are checked. The return value
is a list of the resultant uris created by the store call -- which can contain autogenerated
ids as per the \verb+putDoc+ implementation.
