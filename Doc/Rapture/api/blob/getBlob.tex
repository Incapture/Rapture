The \verb+getBlob+ call is used to retrieve a blob from a repository. The \verb+BlobContainer+ structure
returned is complex - it contains both the content of the blob and any \emph{headers} associated with the
blob as provided by the underlying implementation. The keys to these headers will follow the HTTP protocol format and
include mime type and content size.

Note that \Rapture servers that have the BlobContentServlet installed will support a RESTful interface
to adding content. A "GET" to the url formed by prepending the uri of the blob with the prefix
\verb+/blob/+ will result in a more efficient client side experience, with the mime-type and content size
set in the headers of the return.
