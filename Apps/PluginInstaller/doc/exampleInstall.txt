This describes the example install to test all of the plugins of the pluginInstaller.

1. We have a remote plugin install, setup in a jar file, at file://remote/pluginOne/1.0.0/pluginOne.jar.
2. pluginOne.jar has the following structure
   plugin.txt (simply pluginOne, version 1.0.0, one dependency, pluginTwo, version 1.0.1)
   structure.txt (creates partition "pluginOne", type "testOne")
3. A second remote plugin, pluginTwo.jar, with no dependencies but creates partition pluginTwo, testTwo. It is version 1.0.1
4. A local plugin set, with two folders and one local jar.
4. One local ("localOne", version 1.0.0) depends on pluginOne, version 1.0.0
5. It also depends on "localTwo", version 1.0.1).
6. localThree is a standalone Jar, internally version 1.0.1.

At the end of this install we should have the plugins installed in this order

pluginTwo, pluginOne, localTwo, localOne, localThree.

7. The pluginInstaller is called with a set of files and/or folders, or urls to files.

In this case it will be to the directory localOne, the directory localTwo, and the file localThree.
